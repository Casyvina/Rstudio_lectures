This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 
```{r}
print("String")


print("man")
```

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# 2. Data Concepts
## Datatypes

- What are the different datatypes?
- Why it matters?
- How to convert datatypes

Data types have 5 primary types:
1. Numeric : Whole numbers E.g 20.8, 30.5 e.t.c
2. Integer : Integers E.g 3, 4, 5, etc
3. Character : Strings E.g "Technology", "Joseph"
4. Factor : Categorical Vehicles E.g Rank A, B, C
5. Logical : Logic E.g TRUE/FALSE

```{r}
# character
"the school is closed today. Yay!"
"ATAfrica company"

# numeric
123.01
123

# integer
123L

# logical
TRUE
````

# Convert between  datatypes -------
```{r}
# To numeric
as.numeric("123")
as.numeric("apple")

# To character
as.character(123)
as.character(TRUE)

# To Logical
as.logical("True")
as.logical(123)
as.logical(1)
as.logical(0)
as.logical("joseph")

```

## Data Structures

- What are the different types of data structures?
- When to use which data structure
- Homogenous vs Non-homogenous structures

### Vector

Vectors are one-dimensional datatypes, used to store multiple items of same type in a single object.

E.g 
Company Names - "ATAfrica", "ZTMAcademy", "Ferma", "PhotoSystem"

*Note* num-bytes, Cannot mix numbers and names in the same vector

### Matrix
Matrix is a two dimensional data type, where the data is arranged in the form of rows and columns.

All items in a matrix (across columns as well) should be of the same *data type*.

E.g
Company Names - "ATAfrica", "ZTMAcademy", "Ferma", "PhotoSystem"
Locations - "Lagos", "Australia", "Lokoja", "Akure"

*Note* Matrix is 2-D, Cannot mix numbers and names in the same matrix

### Dataframe

Like matrixm a data.frame is also a two dimensional datatype, where the data is aranged in the form of rows and columns.

But unlike matrix, the columns can be of different data types.

E.g
Company Names - "ATAfrica", "ZTMAcademy", "Ferma", "PhotoSystem"
Locations - "Lagos", "Australia", "Lokoja", "Akure"
Share Price($) - 20.8, 30.1, 10.8, 5.0
Profit - 38.5, 40.5, 17, 14.4

*Note* num-bytes, Use dataframes for tables with different datatypes


### List

List is used to store unstructured data.

Like data.frame, list can store data of different data types.

But unlike, data.frame, the data is not in form of rows and columns. 
A list can even contain one or more data.frames inside it.

*Note* num-bytes, List can hold multiple datatypes

## Key Data Structures
1. Vector
2. Matrix
3. Dataframe
4. List

- other Data structures
1. Time Series
2. Package specific data structures

Data Structures
Homogenous - vectors
Heterogeneous - List, DataFrame

*Note* Lists can hold unstructured data, Dataframes is good for tables


# 3. Vectors
## Vectorization

- Purpose of vectors
Vectorization

### Vectors - Concept
* You have 4 employees
* They have worked for you for different number of months E.g 6, 8, 12, 6 and salary Wages per month is 5000, 15000, 7000, 15000
* How will you store this data in a programming language?

Answer - *Vectorization*
To understand vectorization, lets consider the group of data: Months and Wage per month

How will you calculate Total Wage programmatically?

*Note* One way is to compute one by one (Conventional Way Explicit Loops)

The Alternative way or the vector way is have simultaneous operations i.e Vectorization (R enables vectorization)

#### Case Study : Online Pizza Advertisement

1 - Online Chicken Co. Case Problem

2 - Company inputs and data fields associated with the case

3 - High level solution approach


1. *Online Chicken Co.* 
company request that `"Recommend them as optimal ad strategy"`

I want you to analyze the sale data of 28 days and provide us with the following insights:

* The `impact of revenue increase` by adding an extra shift every 3th day of the week.

* `Recommend advertisement strategy`: Ad-promotion campaign for Tue and Thu (@45% increase in clicks) OR package for Mon-Fri-Sun(@25% increase in clicks)?

*Note* : Have end objective in mind while starting an analysis


2. *Company inputs*

* `Sales data` is available with the company in hard copy only

* First day sales is `200 units`, and has increased daily by `3 unit`

* Analysis to be done for `28 days` for July

* Price of chicken is `#1500`

* On every `3rd day`, company provides `discount of 45%` on this price

* Number of `daily visitors` who visit their website are between `1000 to 1100`

*Note* In real projects, sometimes you may have to make assumptions and create data if it is not available
* If data is available do sanity checks to ensure correctness before proceeding to next step


3. *High Level Solution Approach*

`CREATE` - Sale data, discount data days, visitors

`TRANSFORM` - visitors data, missing values from 'clicks' data

`ANALYZE` - Total revenues for different scenarios

*Note* Creating and transforming data is typically part of any analytics project, 
Analysis of different scenarios enables you to generate holistic insights

## Create vector with a single element

Basic for Programming in R

`Clear screen` `Create a vector` `Check items in R-console`


```{r}
# HOW TO CREATE A SINGLE ELEMENT VECTOR --------

# 1. Create data for a day's sales activity --------
month <- "August_2023" # Create  month vector
month = "August_2023"
month

# 2. See what variables are present in global namespace ---------
ls()
rm(month)
ls()

# Clears the screen
cat("\14") # or `ctrl+L`

# 3. Arrow in opposite direction also works -------
"August_2023" -> month
month

# 4. Check class and length -------
class(month) # Character class
length(month) # Equals 1

# 5. Create day of month ----------
day_of_month <- 16.0 # Create date numeric vector
class(day_of_month)
day_of_month


# 6. Store as integer
day_of_month <-  16L 
class(day_of_month)

# 7. Change to character -------
day_of_month <- as.character(day_of_month) # change class to character
day_of_month
class(day_of_month)

# 8. Change back
day_of_month <- as.numeric(day_of_month) # Change back class to numeric
day_of_month
class(day_of_month)

# 9. Case Sensitive
Day_Of_Month <- 10 # Variables are case sensitive
Day_Of_Month
day_of_month

# Challenge - create a vector for to enter the year value as 2023 and change to character

current_year <- 2023
class(current_year)
current_year  <- as.character(current_year)
class(current_year)
```
### Create group of elementss in a vector

- Create a vector containing multiple elements

- Accesing Element

- Reserving empty space in memory

Example
-Month- Aug_2023, Aug_2023, Aug_2023
-Day of month- 12, 15, 16
-Weekday- Sun, Wed, Thur
-Year- 2023, 2023, 2023
-Day type-WN, WY, WY
-Sales- 100, 103, 105
-Discount- 1, 0.5, 1

```{r}






```
